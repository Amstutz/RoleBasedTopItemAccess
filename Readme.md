# Demo Main Menu Role Based Top Entry

This plugins demonstrate the base setup for adding a new top Main BAr entry that can be controlled through global roles. 
You can add a new Global Role controlled Main Bar entry through:
-> Administration -> Layout and Navigation -> Main Menu ->Â Add New Main Entry -> Check "Global Role Based Access" Radio Option

Further it shows how the deprecated way of modifying templates still works by adding some info to the footer of the page.
